# StableDiffusion-XL-panorama
1. Stable Diffusion XL
   Fine-tuning the stable diffusion xl base 1.0 for panaroma images using the LoRA weights from huggingface.com/jbilcke-hf/sdxl-panorama to generate the 360-degree panoramic images that are coherent. The images are generated to fulfill the following conditions:
   * The scene should look consistent as per the user’s prompt
   * The generated panorama’s ends should meet i.e. seam needs to be tiled.

     Some images that closely follow the conditions are demonstrated below with their corresponding prompts.
